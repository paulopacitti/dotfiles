description: Commit the changes in the staging area
---
- Based on the staged changes, create a concise commit message with a body. To create a commit message, check the previous commit messages as examples.
- If the changes are too small or simple to explain, there's no need to add a body.
- After comming up with a commit message, commit it. Commit only the staged changes, don't add any more changes to the staging area.
